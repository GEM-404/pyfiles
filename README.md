# Python files also found in my /opt dir for simplifying tasks while coding

The files are used as commands in terminal for doing some specific things...

command **pyman** -> _displays how a python module is used in code_

command **pyls** -> _displays what a python module entails, the list of classes and submodules in the module_

This commands can be added as aliases in .bashrc or .zshrc or your preferred .profilerc to be used in a terminal
while coding

** _I use neovim so it's integrated terminal does not give me a hustle to open and check the specific commands_**
